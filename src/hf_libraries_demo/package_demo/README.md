# Package Demo

See [the root README](../../../README.md) for a description of the package layout and setup. I use the `src` layout 
described [here](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html#using-a-src-layout).

This package defines a super simple function which can be imported and used, see 
[the Colab notebook](../../../ImportingAGithubPyPackage.ipynb) for an example.
